### **Description**

A custom search API for food items. Enter the food item name you would like to search on, it will do its magic and insert the name, website link, author and description in Excel Sheet.

### **How does it work?**

* Step one, I set up my Google developer account, created an `API key` and enabled the custom search API. I also created my custom search programmable engine and grabbed the `CX` ID. 

* In my `main.py`, I defined a function called `custom_search` with a `search` parameter. I loaded the API Key from my `.env` file and built a service object to interact with Google using `build`` serivce that google provides. Then, called the `list` method on `service.cse`, passed the `search` and `CX ID` to search on my custom search engine and returned the result.

* I called the `custom_search` function and passed the `search` variable into my main function. I stored the results as `json` file. 

* For parsing the JSON and exporting it into Excel, I created a function called `excel_helper`. I used `xlsxwriter` module to help me parse the JSON data. I created a workbook with the help of `workbook` class that xlswriter provides. I used a while loop for the item count. In my program, I am grabbing the very first item in the search result. To insert selected columns, I used for loop to iterate over each item in the list of columns created and insert it using `.write ` method. To insert rows, I used two for loops, one for the title and link column and the second for the remaining columns.

This is how the magic happens ðŸ˜„

### **What if I want to run it?**

Here are the steps to run on your computer: 

* Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/apis/credentials?authuser=2&supportedpurview=project to grab your `API key.`

* Enable your custom search API here - https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/customsearch.googleapis.com

* Create your custom search engine here at https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all and grab your `CX ID`

* Clone this git repository to your local machine. 

* Insert API Key and CX ID into `.env` file and viola, you are all set to run the program.

### **Conclusion**

While on a path to learning RESTful APIs, this was a fun little side project that showed me the magic of APIs and why it's really useful and essential. Doing this project also showed me an insight into how APIs work and how you can achieve a lot using APIs.
